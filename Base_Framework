# A simple example framework of a trading strategy using XGBoost for a basic buy/sell decision based on price predictions. 
This example uses Python and assumes you have XGBoost and necessary data already loaded.
Can be used as a starting point of developing a full model and strategy

import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load historical price and feature data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')

# Assume 'target' is the column containing future price changes (1 for increase, 0 for decrease)
target = data['target']

# Drop non-feature columns and target column to create the feature set
features = data.drop(['Date', 'target'], axis=1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train an XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Implement a simple trading strategy
def trading_strategy(predictions, threshold=0.5):
    signals = [1 if p > threshold else -1 for p in predictions]  # 1 for buy, -1 for sell
    return signals

threshold = 0.5  # Adjust the threshold as needed

signals = trading_strategy(y_pred, threshold)

# Assume we have a starting capital and an initial position (0 for no position, 1 for long, -1 for short)
capital = 100000
position = 0
current_price = data['Price'].iloc[-1]

# Calculate portfolio value over time
portfolio_values = [capital]

for signal in signals:
    if signal == 1 and position == 0:  # Buy signal
        position = 1
        capital -= current_price
    elif signal == -1 and position == 1:  # Sell signal
        position = 0
        capital += current_price

    portfolio_values.append(capital)

# We can analyze and visualize portfolio performance over time using libraries like Matplotlib
