XGBoost Trading Strategy Example

# Trading strategy starting point using XGBoost for a basic buy/sell decision based on price predictions. 
This example uses Python and assumes we have XGBoost and necessary data already loaded.

# Sample framework to get started. Fully developed and ready to launch trading strategies 
are far more complex and require extensive risk management, 
parameter tuning, and careful consideration of transaction costs as well as other factors. 

# Additionally, this base framework assumes that we have historical data with features and target labels 
(future price changes) available. In real trading, it's essential to be cautious and aware of the risks involved. 
Always conduct thorough testing and validation of strategies in simulated or 
paper trading environments before considering real-money trading.
